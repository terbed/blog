Experience . AI consultant &amp; Developer – Self-Employment . October 2020 – present . contract with the University of Szeged (SZTE), Hungary The project is about improving impaired speech (of dysarthric speakers) with deep learning tools, more precisely with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). | Lately, we experiment with sequence-to-sequence, transformer based voice conversion (VC) models. | . | . June 2022 – present . contract with Daxire FinTech startup Application of machine learning and deep learning to the financial industry. | . | . Developer &amp; Researcher – Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI), Computational Optical Sensing and Processing Laboratory, Budapest, Hungary . August 2017 – present . With an average camera, we are able to detect the subtle color changes in the skin that is associated with the cardiac-cycle, thus we can measure pulse-rate remotely. The name of this field is Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) which was my first topic here. | My tasks were to implement and test existing classical algorithms and deep neural network architectures from literature (python, pytorch, matlab), workout new ones and develop real-time software for (resource limited) embedded system environment (c++, Qt, raspberry pi, nvidia jetson nano). | I developed an iphone application (swift frontend and c++ backend) which can measure pulse from face or palm with front or rear camera. It is freely accessible in the apple appsotre: Remote Pulse App | Since the summer of 2020, I started to work in the field of Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) which operates with coherent light (eg. laser) instead of incoherent light like conventional microscopy. My task is to implement and train deep neural networks which are able to recover phase for a hologram image and generate a brightfield microscope image from a single hologram using generative adversarial networks (GANs). | Additionally, I work on neural-network based hologram focusing and object detection/counting/classification. | . Research Intern – Turbine Ltd. . March 2016 – June 2016 . Turbine’s goal is to design effective cancer combination therapies using artificial intelligence and computer simulations. . My task was to explore machine learning (deep learning) applications in the field of computational biology and present it to the team leader. | . Student Researcher – Institute of Experimental Medicine (KOKI), Computational Neuroscience Workgroup, Budapest, Hungary . September 2015 – March 2022 . Statistical inference of neuron model parameters with computer simulations and Bayesian statistics tools to deliver richer information than simple point estimates (fitting). | I presented this work on Scientific Students’ Associations in Eötvös Loránd University and qualified for National Conference. | The source code (and thesis) can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/terbed/parameter-inference | .
