description: "A Digital Garden: Capturing my daily thoughts and progress, as well as curated ideas, reviews and articles."
footer_description:
  'The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking, writing and creating that focuses less on the
  outcome and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.
  Like gardeners planting seeds and tending the soil, we toil and turn the earth; though blooms may come in their own time, they cannot be rushed or forced.'
