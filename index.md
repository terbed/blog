### Collect. Connect. Create.

<mark>Welcome aboard traveler!</mark>
This is my digital garden where I collect and share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings. 
Allegedly, the best way to learn is to express and explain the material in your own words, in your unique way.
I've always loved to craft and publish articles so I've built this place where I can practice my passion – and hopefully where we can learn together.
The content of this blog has three main channels:
[[“There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” <br><cite>--- Ernest Hemingway </cite>::lmn]]

1. [**Catalogue of Notes:**](/notes)
   - These are brief drafts of my day-to-day engagements with work, which might blossom into full-fledged articles in the future. This is also the space where the supplementary materials (transclusions) for the in-depth articles are collected.
2. [**Daily Progress Journal:**](/journals)
   - A more simple and personal section for daily public writing about my plans, progress, achievements and thoughts.
3. [**In-Depth Articles:**](/posts)
   - Comprehensive pieces where the topics are dissected and discussed at length. These are the carefully crafted end-products of my learning process.


[[Lavoisier once said: “Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme” --- meaning: <br> __“Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.”__::lmn]] 

[[“He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, 
and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.” <br><cite>--- Aeschylus</cite>::rmn]]

The fact that this blog has dedicated sections for [notes](/notes), as well as [journal entries](/journals) is meant 
to encourage daily public writing in line with the [Digital Garden](#digital-gardens-an-overview) philosophy.

The articles are grouped by [tags](/tags) and into [categories](/categories), you can also see them in chronological order on the [dates](/dates) page.
All of the content is accessible (journals, notes, articles) on the [archive](/archive) page, or you can use the search bar to find what you're looking for.

This blog is meant to be a **public** space for learning and growth.
Your insights and perspectives are invaluable. Engage with the content through:
- __Comments__: Share your thoughts, experiences, and queries directly on the blog. Let's foster a community of learning and exchange.
- __Hypothesis Annotations__: For a more interactive and collaborative experience, use the built-in [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/){:target="_blank"} annotations to highlight text, add notes, or start discussions right within the articles. It's a dynamic way to connect and deepen our collective understanding.


## Digital Gardens: An Overview

[[Our natural fear of being judged leads most people to build, learn, and think privately.
But seeking validation should neither be the goal of learning in public. 
<br><br>Instead, the goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops.::lmn]]

<mark>What exactly <i>is</i> a digital garden, you might ask?</mark> 
A Digital Garden is such an online space that is moreso dedicated to the act of learning and growth, rather than final products.


Digital Gardens solve two problems:

[[Many note-takers hoard content because it gives them an illusion of knowledge. <br><br>The best way to truly understand anything is to use the generation effect: to produce your own content, in your own words, and to share it with the world to create a feedback loop.::rmn]] 

1. Our ability to **COMMUNICATE** and **SHARE** on the internet in novel, positive ways.
2. Our ability to **COMPERHEND** and **SYNTHESIZE** information with emphasis on **CREATIVITY** rather than **CONSUMPTION**.

- **Collect**. Note-taking, raw snippets, highlights/annotations + personal commentary.
- **Connect**. Link to previous notes. Do not keep orphan notes.
- **Create**. Write original article.

The only way to learn in public is to **build** in public.

Linear thinking is ultimately a myth. Thinking is not only non-linear, it's messy. The messy wandering where innovation happens.
It involves a lot of back and forth, dead ends, branching, walking back, merging ideas, changing ideas, contradicting ideas.
So let's get into it and make some mess and then clean it up!
