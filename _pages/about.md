Hello there!

My name is Dániel Terbe. I live in Budapest, Hungary. In this page, I collect and summarize
my milestones and achievements. We can look at this as my CV.

I was always interested in science and technology, especially in the field of physics and computer science. Back then I hesitated about which one to choose as a major.
I thought the ultimate thing to learn is physics where I can find answers to questions regarding existence.
Thus, I graduated with a BSc in Physics from Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), Hungary in 2017. During that my interest shifted from "the external to the internal" and I started to learn about the brain and the nervous system.
In line with that, my thesis work was about the statistical inference of biophysical neuron model parameters.
After that, I started Info-Bionics MSc studies at Pázmány Péter Catholic University (PPKE), Hungary, and started to work in the Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI, Hungary) in the Optical Sensing and Processing Laboratory.
So I end up in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. Here I gained a lot of experience in the field of machine learning and deep learning, especially in the field of computer vision and image processing.
My first project here was Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) which is a method to measure pulse-rate from the color changes in the skin remotely with a camera. This was also my master's thesis topic in the university: Remote camera-based pulse estimation using deep learning tools.
This work involved the development of real-time software for embedded systems and an iPhone application. After that in 2020, I started to work in the field of Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM).
Besides that, I had/have many other side projects utilizing machine learning and deep learning tools.


## Experience

### AI consultant & Developer – Self-Employment

**_August 2022 – present_**
- _TongueScanner_
  - In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the tongue is a very important diagnostic tool. The
    tongue is a reflection of the internal organs and their functions and the mirror of the body’s health.
  - TongueScanner is an AI-based tongue analysis tool that can help TCM practitioners to
    diagnose their patients more accurately and efficiently.
  - My role is to research and develop the AI models for the application.

**_June 2022 – September 2022_**
- _contract with a FinTech startup_
  - Application of machine learning and deep learning to the financial industry, focusing on crypto
    currencies.
  - Role: data scientist

**_October 2020 – January 2021_**
- _contract with the University of Szeged (SZTE), Hungary_
  - The project is about improving impaired speech (of dysarthric speakers) with deep learning tools, more precisely with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
  - We also experimented with sequence-to-sequence, transformer based voice conversion (VC) models.


### Developer & Researcher – Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI), Computational Optical Sensing and Processing Laboratory, Budapest, Hungary
**_August 2017 – present_**

- With an average camera, we are able to detect the subtle color changes in the skin that is associated with the cardiac-cycle, thus we can measure pulse-rate remotely. The name of this field is Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) which was my first topic here.
- My tasks were to implement and test existing classical algorithms and deep neural network architectures from literature _(python, pytorch, matlab)_, workout new ones and develop real-time software for (resource limited) embedded system environment _(c++, Qt, raspberry pi, nvidia jetson nano)_.
- I developed an iphone application (_swift_ frontend and _c++_ backend) which can measure pulse from face or palm with front or rear camera. It is freely accessible in the apple appsotre: [Remote Pulse App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote-pulse/id1468899497?l=en)
- Since the summer of 2020, I started to work in the field of Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) which operates with coherent light (eg. laser) instead of incoherent light like conventional microscopy. My task is to implement and train deep neural networks which are able to recover phase for a hologram image and generate a brightfield microscope image from a single hologram using generative adversarial networks (GANs).
- Recently, I lead the AI team and work on neural-network-based hologram focusing, object detection/counting/classification/segmentation tasks and on its deployment in our DHM software for real-world application use cases (for example, automatic water sample analysis at waterworks). The website of the product: [HoloDetect](https://www.holodetect.com/)

### Research Intern – [Turbine Ltd.](https://turbine.ai)
**_March 2016 – June 2016_**

_Turbine’s goal is to design effective cancer combination therapies
using artificial intelligence and computer simulations._
- My task was to explore machine learning (deep learning) applications in the field of computational biology and present it to the team leader.

### Student Researcher – Institute of Experimental Medicine (KOKI), Computational Neuroscience Workgroup, Budapest, Hungary
**_September 2015 – March 2022_**
- Statistical inference of neuron model parameters with computer simulations and Bayesian statistics tools to deliver richer information than simple point estimates (fitting).
- I presented this work on Scientific Students’ Associations in Eötvös Loránd University and qualified for National Conference.
- The source code (and thesis) can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/terbed/parameter-inference
- This study was presented in the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) 2022 conference titled “Reliable estimation of neuronal biophysical parameters from electrophysiological recordings”. The presentation can be seen [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0kfvjkxp6jwm10s/SfN_2022_Kali_v2.mp4?dl=0).
