Hello there! üëã

My name is D√°niel Terbe, residing in the vibrant city of Budapest, Hungary. 
This page serves as a collection and summary of my milestones and achievements, much like a personal CV.

In my academic and professional journey, I have always been deeply intrigued by science and technology, especially in the fields of physics and computer science. 
This dual passion initially presented a dilemma in choosing my major. I was captivated by physics, seeing it as a path to understanding the fundamental questions of existence. 
This fascination led me to pursue a BSc in Physics from E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (ELTE), Hungary, where I graduated in 2017. 
However, during my undergraduate studies, my interests took a pivotal turn from exploring the external universe to delving into the internal complexities of the human mind. 
In line with this shift, my thesis work was centered on the statistical inference of biophysical neuron model parameters, a project I undertook in collaboration with KOKI (Institute of Experimental Medicine ‚Äì Theoretical Neuroscience Research Laboratory).

Following my graduation, I embarked on an MSc in Info-Bionics at P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University (PPKE), Hungary. 
Concurrently, I began my professional career at the Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI), Hungary, in the Optical Sensing and Processing Laboratory. 
Here, in the domain of computer science and artificial intelligence, I gained extensive experience in machine learning and deep learning, particularly focusing on computer vision and image processing. 
My first major project at SZTAKI involved Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG), a novel method for measuring pulse rate remotely from color changes in the skin using camera technology. 
This groundbreaking work, which was also the subject of my master's thesis, entailed the development of real-time software for embedded systems and an iPhone application. 
In 2020, I expanded my professional scope by venturing into Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM).

Additionally, I have been involved in various side projects that leverage machine learning and deep learning tools, further enhancing my expertise in these areas.
In the followings I will list some of my projects and experiences.

## Experience

### AI Consultant & Developer ‚Äì Self-Employment
**_August 2022 ‚Äì January 2022_**
- **_TongueScanner:_** A pioneering AI-based tongue analysis tool for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The tongue is a reflection of the internal organs and their functions and the mirror of the body‚Äôs health. This project aims to enhance the diagnostic processes for TCM practitioners by analyzing various aspects of the tongue's appearance.

**_June 2022 ‚Äì September 2022_**
- **Contract with a FinTech Startup:** My role focused on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to the financial industry. The primary area of application was in the cryptocurrency sector, developing models and strategies for financial analysis and predictions.

**_October 2020 ‚Äì January 2021_**
- **Contract with the University of Szeged (SZTE), Hungary:** Involved in a project aimed at improving impaired speech using deep learning tools. The main focus was on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and exploring transformer-based voice conversion models for dysarthric speakers.

### Developer & Researcher ‚Äì Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI)
**_August 2017 ‚Äì present_**
- **Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG):** Initiated and developed a project where we used average cameras to detect subtle color changes in the skin associated with the cardiac cycle, allowing us to measure pulse-rate remotely. This project also led to the development of an iPhone application which measures pulse from the face or palm and is available in the Apple App Store: [Remote Pulse App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote-pulse/id1468899497?l=en).
- **Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM):** Since 2020, I have been working on this innovative field, focusing on utilizing coherent light (e.g., laser) for microscopy. My responsibilities include implementing and training deep neural networks for hologram image processing and developing applications for real-world use cases such as automatic water sample analysis at waterworks.
