Hello there! \
My name is Dániel Terbe. I live in Budapest, Hungary. In this page, I collect and summarize
my milestones and achievements. We can look at this as my CV.


## Experience

### AI consultant & Developer – Self-Employment

**_August 2022 – present_**
- _TongueScanner_
  - In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the tongue is a very important diagnostic tool. The
    tongue is a reflection of the internal organs and their functions and the mirror of the body’s health. 
  - TongueScanner is an AI-based tongue analysis tool that can help TCM practitioners to
    diagnose their patients more accurately and efficiently.
  - My role is to research and develop the AI models for the application.

**_June 2022 – September 2022_**
- _contract with [Daxire](https://daxire.com) FinTech startup_
  - Application of machine learning and deep learning to the financial industry, focusing on crypto
    currencies.
  - Role: data scientist

**_October 2020 – January 2021_**
- _contract with the University of Szeged (SZTE), Hungary_
  - The project is about improving impaired speech (of dysarthric speakers) with deep learning tools, more precisely with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
  - Lately, we experiment with sequence-to-sequence, transformer based voice conversion (VC) models.


### Developer & Researcher – Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI), Computational Optical Sensing and Processing Laboratory, Budapest, Hungary
**_August 2017 – present_**

- With an average camera, we are able to detect the subtle color changes in the skin that is associated with the cardiac-cycle, thus we can measure pulse-rate remotely. The name of this field is Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) which was my first topic here.
- My tasks were to implement and test existing classical algorithms and deep neural network architectures from literature _(python, pytorch, matlab)_, workout new ones and develop real-time software for (resource limited) embedded system environment _(c++, Qt, raspberry pi, nvidia jetson nano)_.
- I developed an iphone application (_swift_ frontend and _c++_ backend) which can measure pulse from face or palm with front or rear camera. It is freely accessible in the apple appsotre: [Remote Pulse App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote-pulse/id1468899497?l=en)
- Since the summer of 2020, I started to work in the field of Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) which operates with coherent light (eg. laser) instead of incoherent light like conventional microscopy. My task is to implement and train deep neural networks which are able to recover phase for a hologram image and generate a brightfield microscope image from a single hologram using generative adversarial networks (GANs). 
- Recently, I work on neural-network-based hologram focusing and object detection/counting/classification/segmentation tasks and on its deployment for real-world application use cases.

### Research Intern – [Turbine Ltd.](https://turbine.ai)
**_March 2016 – June 2016_**

_Turbine’s goal is to design effective cancer combination therapies
using artificial intelligence and computer simulations._
- My task was to explore machine learning (deep learning) applications in the field of computational biology and present it to the team leader.

### Student Researcher – Institute of Experimental Medicine (KOKI), Computational Neuroscience Workgroup, Budapest, Hungary
**_September 2015 – March 2022_**
- Statistical inference of neuron model parameters with computer simulations and Bayesian statistics tools to deliver richer information than simple point estimates (fitting).
- I presented this work on Scientific Students’ Associations in Eötvös Loránd University and qualified for National Conference.
- The source code (and thesis) can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/terbed/parameter-inference

## Education

### BSc. Physics with Theoretical Physics specialization in Eötvös Loránd University Budapest, Hungary
_From 2013 to 2017_

My thesis work was about statistical inference of biophysical neuron model parameters.

### MSc. Info-Bionics Engineering with specialization in Bionic Interfaces and Integrated Structures in Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary
_From 2017 to 2020_

The title of my thesis work: Remote camera-based pulse estimation using deep learning tools which can be found [here](https://github.com/terbed/Deep-rPPG) on GitHub.

## Other

### Summer school
 Eastern European Machine Learning summer school, organised in Virtual Budapest between 7-15th of July, 2021.

### [Remote Pulse iphone App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote-pulse/id1468899497?l=en)

I developed an Iphone application that can measure pulse remotely from face or palm. It is freely available in the apple appstore. The core algorithm is written in c++ and the UI is in swift.

## Hobby
I like winter sports and mountain biking or hiking in nature. In my free time I play music, sing, read books, do yoga and meditate regularly.
