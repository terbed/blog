## Basic
### Q1: What is quantitative finance and how does it differ from traditional finance?
Quantitative finance is a multidisciplinary field that combines finance, mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This approach is employed to solve numerous financial problems, including trading strategy development, risk management, and investment by utilizing mathematical and computational tools.

The decision-making process in traditional finance is primarily based on judgment, intuition, and gut feeling, focusing on financial statements, market trends, and economic indicators interpreted through the lens of human experience. This approach relies heavily on the subjective insights of financial professionals. In contrast, quantitative finance relies on mathematical models, statistical methods, and computational algorithms to analyze financial data, derive insights, and make predictions – leading to a more objective, data-driven, evidence-based and systematic decision-making process.

The systematic approach enables quantitative finance team to work on the same project and collaborate across different expertise areas allowing more comprehensive and cohesive project development. In contrast, traditional financial professional often work independently in silos and the decision-making process is less transparent and may be more prone to biases.
 
In conclusion, quantitative finance offers a more rigorous and systematic approach to financial analysis compared to traditional finance. By integrating mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques, it enables more objective, data-driven decision-making and fosters collaboration across different expertise areas.

### Q2: What are the main types of financial assets?
Financial assets are instruments that represent ownership or contractual right to an asset or a stream of income. There are several main types of financial assets:

__1.) Stocks (Equities):__ Stocks represent ownership in a company and entitle the holder to a share of the company's profits and assets. Returns on stocks come from dividends and capital gains (capital appreciation). The value of the stock is determined by the company's performance and market demand.

__2.) Bonds:__ Bonds are debt instruments issued by governments or corporations to raise capital. When investors buy a bond, they are lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the principal amount at maturity. Bonds are considered less risky than stocks but offer lower returns.

__3.) Derivatives:__ Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset. Common types of derivatives include options, futures, forwards, and swaps. Derivatives are used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.

__4.) Commodities:__ Commodities are physical goods such as gold, oil, wheat, and coffee that are traded on commodity exchanges. Investors can buy and sell commodities directly or through commodity futures contracts.

__5.) Real Estate:__ Real estate assets include residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Real estate can generate rental income and capital appreciation.

There are other types of financial assets too, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), currencies, and cryptocurrencies.
