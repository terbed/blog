## Basic
### Q1: What is quantitative finance and how does it differ from traditional finance?
Quantitative finance is a multidisciplinary field that combines finance, mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This approach is employed to solve numerous financial problems, including trading strategy development, risk management, and investment by utilizing mathematical and computational tools.

The decision-making process in traditional finance are primarily based on judgement, intuition, and gut-feeling. This approach relies heavily on the experience and subjective insights of financial professionals. In contrast, quantitative finance relies on mathematical models, statistical methods, and computational algorithms to analyze financial data and derive insights, leading to a more objective, data-driven, evidence-based and systematic decision-making.

Traditional finance is often qualitative, focusing on financial statements, market trends, and economic indicators interpreted through the lens of human experience, while quantitative finance emphasizes quantitative analysis, using large datasets, mathematical modeling, and algorithmic trading to identify patterns and make predictions.

The systematic approach enables quantitative finance team to work on the same project and collaborate across different expertise areas rather than working alone in silos – which is often the case in traditional finance – allowing more comprehensive and cohesive project development.
 
In conclusion, quantitative finance offers a more rigorous and systematic approach to financial analysis compared to traditional finance. By integrating mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques, it enables more objective, data-driven decision-making and fosters collaboration across different expertise areas.
